    <h4>DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotic Challenge</h4>
    <p id="mid">Partnering with Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and DSO National Laboratories, VJC organises an annual robotics competition for primary and secondary school students. Students are given a challenge in which they are required to build at least a robot with VEX or Lego Mindstorm EV3 parts in order to attain the highest point possible. This challenge is meant to put students' creativity, innovation and teamwork to the test. VRMC is the main student body that is involved in the organisation of this challenge.
