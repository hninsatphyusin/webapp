    <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
    <p>The robotics and makers club was forged from the merger of two different clubs, the robotics club and the makers club. Since then, VRMC has been a place where students refine their creativity, innovation, teamwork and critical thinking skills. It is also a tight knitted community with like-minded people who drive one another to push the boundaries of what can be done, developing critical life and career skills in the process. It is a place where people can feel free to express their ideas and thoughts to achieve something great together.</p>
    <h2>VEX</h2>
    <p>The vex team is passionate in building robots to compete and win. We play around with metal parts, prototype innovative mechanisms, code programs to complete tasks and drive robots to victory. This is the spec that works hard and plays hard with real robots.</p>
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>The programming spec is a closely knitted group of people who are interested in solving coding problems and undertaking programming-related projects. The programming spec learns new concepts and ideas from one another. This is done through an open discussion for every obstacle encountered in a coding problem. All in all, the programming spec enjoys solving programming problems together.</p>
    <p><span>Competitions:</span> Programming NOI, SMU Whitehacks, CSIT-HCI Cyberthon 2022, IDE Code Hacker, DSTA Brainhacks, SCSE Computing Challenge.</p>
    <h2>Electronics</h2>
    <p>A team who is passionate about tinkering. We enjoy making creative projects and competing. They also call us the iron man wannabes.</p>
    <p><span>Competitions: </span>Singapore Robotic Games: Underwater Bot Competition, SAFMC D1 Category: Building a quadcopter (with drones), RoboClash</p>
    <h2>Drones</h2>
    <p>At Drones, we work in 2 main categories: Fixed Wing Planes and Quadcopter Building. We participate in competitions like the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competion, where we come up against tough competition to beat obstacles in our way.</p>
